# Brastlewark - Code challenge

# Why I use.....

#### As requested here is a list of the libraries I used on the demo and why

* **SDWebImage**: Common library to request images from a URL, this library is very useful manage the cache.

* **DZNEmptyDataSet:** With this library we can conform UITableView and UICollectionView delegates and data sources to response to an empty array and creates empty states easily.

* **Mantle:** With this library we can simplify the JSON mapping process, useful transformations and we can create ours owns.

* **ReactiveCocoa:** With this library we can be more in control over async tasks and provide several extension to make responsive UIs. Also great for UI bindings.


# Hidden features 
#### As is probable to miss features on this demo app, here a list of them:

* Zoomable ImageView: Every UIImageView had a pinch gesture to zoom in and zoom out like Instagram does.
